= DATEX =
A `prototype` for a data exchange server and client between DMI and SMHI,
using rpclite and zmq's publish/subscibe.

It goes like this:

== Server ==
 * rpclite: register services
 * zmq: start publisher in a separate process
 * make sure publisher only run when rpc server is running 

== Client ==
 * zmq: start subscriber in same process/thread (zmq has it's own threaded queue)
 * rpclite: for each new subscribe message fetch the corresponding file.


The configuration of the client and server is defined in the etc/datex.cfg
file. It has to contain the "server" and "client" sections, defining the
variables "host", "rpc_port", and "publish_port". Moreover, if you want the
server to serve anything, it can be good to add datatype sections, for
example::

 [datatype-pol_L0]
 distribute = True
 glob = *.hrpt.bz2
 dir = /net/prodsat/datadb/sat/polar/smb/level0
 format = hrpt
 compressed = 'yes'

The "distribute" flag tells if the given datatype needs to be distributed by
the publisher, the "glob" variable describes the filename pattern, the "dir"
variable is self describing, the "format" gives the format of the file, while
the compressed flag tells if the data is compressed or not.

Once everything is defined, you just need to start the client and the
server. Here is the usage of the client::

  datex_client -d<datatype> [-c] [-H] [info|list|latest|get filename]
      -c, md5 check of received file
      -H, this info
      if not arguments it will listen for published files, and fetch'm.

and here is the usage of the server::

  datex_server [-D]
      -D, run as daemon
