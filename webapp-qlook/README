Flask + ElevateZoom example
===========================
Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
ElevateZoom: http://www.elevateweb.co.uk/image-zoom

This is an example of using ElevateZoom to display satellite images
and using Flask as webapp framework. You only need to install Flask
(see website).

After installing Flask:
> python ./qlook.py
and point your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/qlook

The images in this example is not very big, so I have included an image
of the setup here at DMI (qlook_at_dmi.png).
