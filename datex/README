= DATEX =
A `prototype` for a data exchange server and client between DMI and SMHI,
using rpclite and zmq's publish/subscibe.

It goes like this:

== Server ==
 * rpclite: register services
 * zmq: start publisher in a separate process
 * make sure publisher only run when rpc server is running 

== Client ==
 * zmq: start subscriber in same process/thread (zmq has it's own threaded queue)
 * rpclite: for each new subscribe message fetch the corresponding file.
